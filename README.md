# Odin Recipes

This is a basic HTML project built. The goal was to practice foundational HTML skills by creating a simple recipe website with multiple linked pages.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Writing clean and structured HTML
- Creating multiple HTML pages and linking them together
- Organizing files into logical directories
- Embedding images and using alt text
- Using Git for version control (add, commit, push)
- Publishing my project to GitHub using SSH
