        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Potato and Cheese Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook potatoes in salty water until you can easily pierce them with
                 a fork. Drain water from cooked potatoes. Mash them with some warm 
                 milk and butter. Mix in cheese.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Pierogi Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs and sour cream and milk until you get an even texture
            </li>
            <li>
                To the liquid ingredients, add in flour and salt
            </li>
            <li>
                Knead the dough by hand or by using a standing mixer. Allow 
                dough to rest for 10 minutes once fully kneaded and elastic.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Making Pierogi</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll out the dough on a well floured surface. Cut circles out
                 of the dough using a cookie cutter or a floured glass cup.
            </li>
            <li>
                One by one, spoon filling into dough dough. Fold the dough over 
                to create a quesadilla or empanada shape. Pinch edges together 
                with your fingers to seal the filling inside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flour the surface where you plan to place pierogi. 
                Note: You can freeze the pierogi at this point and save 
                them for later.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cooking Pierogi</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
               Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. One by one, add pierogi 
               into the boiling water. Once they float to the top (10-15 minutes 
               into the cooking), they are fully cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
